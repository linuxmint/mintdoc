"Finally, software which is distributed in this way is often, by virtue of "

"to run. Since a third-party software developer cannot know which data "
"libraries you may already have available on your system, the only way that "
"they can guarantee it will run on your system is by supplying all of the "
"data libraries it needs along with the program itself. This means bigger "
"downloads, and it means that when the time comes to update a given library, "
"it needs to be done separately for all those programs using it, instead of "
"just once. In summary, the distribution of static software results in the "
"unnecessary duplication of a lot of work."

"Software is first written by a developer, as you might expect, and this end "
"of the production chain is known as “upstream”. As a user of a Linux "
"distribution, you are referred to as being at the furthest point "
"“downstream” (unless you're an admin, in which case your users are the "
"furthest point downstream, but you knew that because you're an admin). Once "
"the developer is happy with the program or the update to the program they "
"have written, they will release the source code for it. They will also "
"communicate in their documentation which data libraries or other programs "
"they took advantage of when they were writing the program. They have been "
"doing this for some time and there are standardized and venerable ways for "
"them to do this. Note that, with a few exceptions (usually either hardware "
"manufacturers who release drivers for Linux, like nVidia or ATI, or certain "
"major companies like Adobe, who we can trust) they release the actual source "
"code for the program, that is, the list of instructions in that program in a "
"human readable form. This has a number of implications, but most importantly "
"for this discussion it means that they are willing to have their software "
"peer reviewed by anyone and everyone with an Internet connection. It's "
"awfully difficult to sneak spyware into your program when you're letting "
"everyone see what you've written!"

"The software now moves down the stream to package maintainers, who are "
"either volunteers or paid employees working for a Linux distribution. It is "
"their responsibility to compile the source code for the software, test it on "
"the distribution to make sure that it works, resolve any problems that they "
"encounter and finally package the compiled (i.e., machine-readable) software "
"in a convenient format. This package contains the executable program(s), "
"their configuration files, and the instructions the package management "
"software needs to successfully install it. Note that it won't ordinarily "
"contain any static libraries, since it doesn't need to – the libraries are "
"provided by other packages, and are therefore known as shared libraries. "
"Your package management software will know if that a particular package "
"requires another package to be installed first (like a shared library), "
"because, as you will remember, the data libraries and related packages "
"needed for the software to work were declared further upstream and that "
"information is included in the package. The instructions are sufficiently "
"detailed that even specific versions of other packages can be requested to "
"ensure interoperability. The finished package is then uploaded to a special "
"file server, which is called a software repository."

"It is from that single location that you are able to download and install "

"it is signed with a certificate that your package manager will check. You "
"will also know that each individual package that you install is secure, "
"because each package is itself signed by a GPG key, which your package "
"manager will also check. Your package manager will even run an MD5 sum on "
"each package to make sure that nothing went wrong when it was downloading, "
"just like we did before with the LiveDVD iso. Notice how it's doing all of "
"this for you. You're just sitting back, sipping a martini, and chatting in "
"#linuxmint on xchat. The package manager has downloaded the packages you "
"have selected, it will follow, to the letter (computers are fastidious in "
"following instructions), the instructions in the package to perfectly "
"install your software, and all of its dependencies, in the right order. "
"There is no space for human error – if the package worked on the "

"Humans err where computers don't and from time to time something may go "

"We've all done that. Or perhaps there's a bug or your favorite feature was "
"removed by the program's developer for some reason. These problems "
"demonstrate, paradoxically, the strength and security of package management. "
"Because your package manager keeps fastidious records of everything it ever "
"does, it is able to reverse installations, cleanly and completely. It will "
"make sure that removing one package doesn't break any others, and you can "
"even tell it specifically to do things like not automatically upgrade "
"certain packages, because you like them the way they are, or to revert to an "
"earlier version. Finally, the whole process is very heavily peer-reviewed. "

"be resolved quickly! In this way, software distribution in GNU/Linux "
"distributions is very much based on trust, from the moment the original "
"developer displays their source code for all to see, to the open discussion "
"on the distribution's website. You can be confident in the software you "

"A final word. You may have been subjected to rumors to the effect that Linux "

"never be “finished”, any more than any other major operating system can be "
"considered “finished”. From the Linux kernel to the artwork on your screen, "
"all the elements of your operating system will always be under some kind of "
"development. This is because programmers are working hard to keep us up to "
"date with the latest developments in programming and hardware technology. "
"This does not mean that the software available for you to use is of bad "
"quality. The base system at the core of Linux Mint has been under heavy "
"development for about two decades now, and is very mature, stable, and "
"proven. While there are definitely unstable versions of most of the software "
"on your operating system, you won't be using them because you're not a beta "
"tester. You know you're not a beta tester, because you're reading this. The "
"software available to you on the repositories you use will always be stable "
"and well tested, unless you change those repositories to the ones used by "
"the testers (in which case congratulations, you've just become a tester). "
